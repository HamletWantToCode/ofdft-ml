OFDFT-ML: Orbital free density functional theory run on machine learning
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is aimed to implement the orbital free density functional theory in a machine learning way, our method will learn a effective energy functional from DFT calculated dataset, and find the ground state electron density of a given potential by solving Euler-Lagrange equation.
